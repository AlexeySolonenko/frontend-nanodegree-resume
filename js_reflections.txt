Today is Easter. I started JSBasics course for the second time.
I had to interrupt the first time to complete a course in Git. 
A course in Git was very useful. I am really glad that I put so
much of effort into it. I am glad that I did this course.

Reflections on JS.

What is your first impression on JS.
I find JS to be quite flexible and easy to write language.
I know, that easiness of writing, as well as low strictness
of definitions will shows its implications later on. However,
flexibility with operators, sizes of numbers, strings, and 
variables so far gives me confidence.

What topics have you studied so far?
Addressing of HTML elements through JS. JS stings, arrays, and now object.
Console - an important and handy tool.

Idea: start reflections with some Key Features section.
Started actually.

Completed section on JS objects. A really useful insight. Key things to keep in mind:
(1) almost anything can incorportate enything; (2) dot notation and square bracket notation;
(3) [] - to address object elements names with forbidden symbols, like, for instance,
ones to pass to php. 
(4) - some literal notation using a colon - not clear what did they mean - most probably
assignments inside the object structure;
(5) JSON concept model - quite convenient;
(6) OVerall - OK, forces you to google a lot of things and to experinment strictly within
a particular area of study at one time.

Completed problem set 4. Replace function, regular expressions.
Was a hard, tedious, but fruitful excercise. I read a lot about regular
expressions. Perhaps, it may be useful to memorize them in future.
Also I collected all the links in the file. I think, I should carefully read
them all one by one. 
The course is good because it pointed out important and practical aspects, like
dot and bracket notations.
Also there was a piece of practice with accessing html properties through JS.
And a lot of work with replacements.
